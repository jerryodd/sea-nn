It was trained off-chain using the MNIST dataset, and then the model was uploaded on-chain.

The model is largely based on the one described |here;https://victorzhou.com/blog/intro-to-cnns-part-1/|
In order to optimize the model for on-chain execution, several optimizations had to be performed ðŸ˜›

- Every pixel is either 0 or 1, so a single bit can be used to represent it.
- All 512 possible 3x3 convolutions are precomputed and stored in a lookup table.
- Rather than representing weights as floats, signed integers in the range of [-2^15, 2^15] are used.

The entire contract is a single 73-line python file, enabled by Seahorse's brevity.
